PROJECT NAME:

Game Development using Kaboom.js

INTRODUCTION: 

You have crashed landed on an Alien Ocean World and the only way is to go is through the deep down 
into the mysterious ocean. Descend into the depths of a vast underwater world filled with wonder 
and peril.

Craft equipment, pilot submarines an outsmart wildlife to explore lush coral reefs, volcanoes, 
cave system and more while trying to survive the ocean predators.

Find and develop the equipment you need to survive and explore. 

Collect resources from the ocean around you like gathering food to stabilize the oxygen level 
and collecting the dismembered parts of the spaceship . 
Explore the world and scan scattered fragments from the wrecked spaceship to unlock new technologies 
that you will need to survive and explore further. 
While exploring beware of repulsive wildlife which includes swordfish, pufferfish, eel and many more. 
While exploring if you come across kyanite which is an extremely rare resource (element) and 
ion tube (element) you will be able to build a repulsion canon whichwill help you to overcome 
the wildlife which may come along the way. 

If you find glass and a battery you will be able to create a flashlight which will enable you 
to see clearly into the ocean.

And lastly if you find titanium(substance), fossil fuel, ion power cell you will be able
to build a single chamber pod and with the help of fuel it will act as a space ship which will
send you home i.e., you will win the game, otherwise if the diver faces an oxygen crisis, then
merely the Deep-Sea Exploration comes to the conclusion! . 

The inspiration behind this game came from the vast collection of movies and games based on curious pursuers of
unexplored parts of the world. While researching the idea behind the theme, we came across
the spring of life-era game "Diver Jimmy!" and want to incorporate it into our thrilling game.
